  <p>My first “group” project turned out to be more of a solo adventure than I expected. While I initially imagined it would be a collaborative effort, I ended up taking responsibility for almost everything. This turned out to be a powerful lesson in independence, perseverance, and problem-solving.</p>

  <p>The project was a <strong>Python-based student task manager</strong> that I built with <strong>HTML and CSS for the front-end</strong>. The goal was to create a system where tasks could be added, marked as complete, and displayed in an organized way, all while keeping it user-friendly and visually clean. Working on it by myself gave me a first-hand experience of what it feels like to own a project from start to finish. I have so much respect for front-end developers now 🙏 🙇‍♀️</p>

  <p>Some challenges I faced were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Integrating Python logic with HTML front-end:</strong> Initially, connecting the backend data to a web interface felt confusing. I had to learn how to pass data dynamically and update the interface seamlessly.</li>
    <li><strong>Handling task data:</strong> Managing the creation, updating, and deletion of tasks without breaking the application required careful planning of functions and error handling.</li>
    <li><strong>Styling and layout:</strong> Making the interface clean and intuitive was harder than I expected. I spent time experimenting with CSS layouts and design to make it easy to read and use.</li>
    <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> There were moments when nothing seemed to work — buttons wouldn’t trigger functions, or tasks disappeared unexpectedly. Tackling these issues taught me patience and systematic debugging techniques.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Through these challenges, I learned a lot about <strong>time management, problem-solving, and perseverance</strong>. Every error became a mini puzzle to solve, and figuring it out myself gave a real sense of accomplishment. I also realized the importance of planning ahead — even small projects benefit from thinking about structure and workflow before writing code.</p>

  <p>By the end of the project, I had a fully functional task manager and a lot more confidence in my abilities. It taught me that even when a project doesn’t go as planned or support isn’t available, you can still learn, grow, and create something meaningful. It was exhausting, eye-opening, and incredibly rewarding, a reminder that every challenge is an opportunity to stretch your skills and discover what you’re capable of.</p>
