  <p>When I first started coding, my scripts were messy. Variables had short names and functions tried to do too many things at once. The programs worked, but they were not readable for me or anyone else.</p>

  <div class="soft-box">
    Clean coding first started making sense to me during my <strong>Operating Systems</strong> course.  
    My professor explained how OS components stay organised such as memory, processes, and files, and how even small disorder can affect the whole system.  
    He connected it to everyday life and how keeping our things in place makes everything smoother and lighter.  
    It even made me think about how often we rely on our mothers for tiny problems because something is misplaced.  
    Good organisation in code or life reduces confusion and lightens the load on the people around us.
  </div>

  <p>As I continued learning, I realised that clean code is not about perfection or aesthetics. It is about care for your future self and consideration for anyone who might read your work. Clean code makes thinking clearer, debugging easier, and problem solving more peaceful.</p>

  <p>Some lessons that shaped the way I write code:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using <strong>meaningful names</strong> because clear names make the logic understandable without extra comments.</li>
    <li>Following the <strong>single responsibility idea</strong> so each function has one clear purpose.</li>
    <li>Maintaining <strong>readable formatting</strong> with consistent spacing and structure.</li>
    <li>Practicing <strong>refactoring</strong> so old code becomes cleaner as I grow.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Because of these principles, coding feels peaceful and structured. Mistakes are easier to notice and collaboration feels smoother. Clean code is a mindset and a calm way of building things.</p>

  <p>That is why I fell in love with clean code, for the clarity and creativity it brings into everything I build.</p>
