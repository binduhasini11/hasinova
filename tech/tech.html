  <p>When I first started coding, my scripts were messy. Variables had names like x1 or temp, and functions tried to do too many things at once. The programs worked, but they weren’t readable — not for me, and definitely not for anyone else.</p>

  <div class="soft-box">
    Clean coding first started making sense to me during my <strong>"Operating Systems"</strong> course.  
    My professor explained how OS components stay organised — memory, processes, files — and how even the smallest disorder can affect the entire system.  
    He compared it to real life: how keeping our space tidy makes everything easier and smoother, and how being organised lightens the load on those around us.  
    It even made me realise how often we turn to our mothers for every tiny problem simply because we misplaced something.  
    Organisation — in our code or in our lives — is a quiet kind of kindness.
  </div>

  <p>As I kept learning, I realised that clean code isn’t about perfection or aesthetics; it’s about respect. Respect for your future self, for anyone who reads your work, and for the craft of programming itself. Clean code makes thinking clearer, debugging faster, and problem-solving less chaotic.</p>

  <p>Some lessons that truly shaped the way I code:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using <strong>meaningful names</strong> — choosing clear and intuitive names makes your logic understandable even without comments.</li>
    <li>Following the <strong>single responsibility idea</strong> — letting every function focus on one task keeps everything organised.</li>
    <li>Maintaining <strong>readable formatting</strong> — consistent spacing and indentation give your code room to breathe.</li>
    <li>Practicing <strong>refactoring</strong> — revisiting and improving old code isn’t wasted effort; it’s growth.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Because of these principles, coding feels more peaceful to me now. Mistakes are easier to find, collaboration feels smoother, and projects have a rhythm. Clean code isn’t just a technique — it’s a mindset. A quiet, intentional way of building things.</p>

  <p>And that’s why I fell in love with clean code: not for the neatness itself, but for the clarity, care, and creativity it brings out in everything I build.</p>
