      <h2>The Sea</h2>
      <p class="post-date">November 9, 2025 • Poem</p>

      <pre class="poem-text">
There's something about the sea that I always found to be soothing and assuring..
It wasn't just the subtle sound of waves crashing against the shore,
Or the blazing ball of fire setting at its core..
The sea was ever changing, continuously renewed as it churned.
And it didn't listen to anyone.
No one told the sea it wasn't good enough. No one could predict or control it.
It was calm and still a moment, rough and rigid the next.
The sea made its own rules. It was the one thing man couldn't conquer.
No one argued with power of that magnitude.
Land was weak. It let itself be dominated, but the sea never folded.
